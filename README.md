This survey is an example of user interface questions that will help Matrix Lotus with its research into the women's cyclical nature. This survey is for people with a female reproductive system between the ages of 18 and 45, and is initially for US residents only. All answers are taken anonymously.

The code starts by importing the `sys` library by typing `import sys` at the top of the file where `sys.exit()` will exit the survey when users enter an answer that disqualifies them from completing the survey.

The users are asked to input their age as an integer. The `inputNumber` function confirms the users' input is an integer. Non-integer inputs are returned to user with an `invalid entry`

The survey consists generating user inputs of twelve (12) questions, with responses controlled by `if/else` and `if/elif/else` blocks.
