This survey is an example of user interface questions that will help Matrix Lotus with its research into women's cyclical nature. This survey is for people with a female reproductive system between the ages of 18 and 45, and is initially for US residents only. All answers are taken unanimously.

The code starts by importing the `sys` library by typing `import sys` at the top of the file where `sys.exit()` will exit the survey when users enter an answer that disqualifies them from completing the survey.
